My favorite dish is the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict
Only went here once about a year and a half ago, but they had great pancakes
It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast
Last time I was here I ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll
i've only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, and the bacon was perfectly crispy
the hashbrowns are the best i've had in a long time - perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside
the pancakes are huge and light and amazing
the cinnamon rolls taste just as good as they look
The size of the cinnamon rolls was insane
i went with the cinnamon roll french toast and was very pleased
very large portion and great taste - go witht the sausage patty over the links
the patty was good
wife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns
hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh
The SO and I split the chicken fried steak, which comes with plenty of toast, hashbrowns, and two eggs
The gravy must be the same that they use for biscuits and gravy, because it tasted sausage-y, and as my plate sat there I could see the grease rising to the top
Pine Cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat
And I got a pig cookie
The pie was delicious
I went with a simple apple selection
It is nothing crazy, no fancy name but truthfully one of the best piece of classic apple you can find around here
The breakfast burrito I had was "meh"
I had the scramble, and it was as good as always
For my work lunch I ordered the CBLT, a nicely toasted BLT with a thick cut of bacon and some cheddar melted in
Today, my wife had an egg sandwich with ham
The yogurt parfait my daughter ordered had fresh fruit and crunchy granola
Eggs were good
Bacon and toast ok
Homefries were kinda greasy, but tasted awesome
Pancake is where it's at
Coffee was good, corned beef hash was OK but not great
Breakfasts are definitely of the "this is not healthy for you" variety, but it's good for a treat (I don't know how my kid made it through his cinnamon-swirl pancakes which were topped with the kind of glaze you put on cinnamon rolls, especially after he added syrup to it
I do love the bakery items so couldn't resist the pecan roll, but my egg sandwich with hash browns could have been better
The hash browns were cold and the croissant was dry
The bacon however, crispy, just like I requested
Red Lobster is always really crowded because peeps love the cheddar biscuits
We all know it's the damn cheddar biscuits that keep em' coming
cant get enough of those biscuits
The Biscuits may be a draw for some ,(altho I can only eat one myself)
I go back over and over because of the great staff, the impeccable Long Island Iced Teas and the always Hot Steamy Perfect  FRESH Lobster
They don't even glamorize this real-deal burger with 16oz beef, 8 strips bacon and a think layer of melty cheese for $8
Is it the best burger in Madison
Is it the best burger
Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten
The vegetables are fresh and generous
If you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar, this is the place to go
If you order the bacon burger, you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it, I was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger
I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always
The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh
Mango Lassi - creamy and refreshing, not too sweet
Chicken Masala - sauce was a little thick but well spiced
Malai Kofta - sauce was a better consistency but was not a fan of the homemade cheese balls
Peas Pulaou - ok
Plain and Garlic Naan - both good but the garlic one kicks it up a notch
We look forward to gorging on their delicious naan, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and rice
Once I got her to try the palak panner she was hooked
Their chicken tikka is the best I've had
The chicken is flavorful and the sauce has a creamy and silky texture, perfect to dip your naan in
Oh, and the mango lassi is delicious
They had a fantastic chick pea salad and I really liked the Tandori Chicken and rice pudding
I enjoyed the Chicken Tandoori and Curry Chicken,
I also liked the rice pudding
I will say that their chicken tikki masala is not my favorite but overall for the ambiance, this place is super pretty and delicious
The saag paneer was warm at best
The tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for Indian buffets) and once again, not hot
The samosas, garlic naan, biryani, and lamb korma are among my favorites, and should always be had with a mango lassi
Some of the best vegetable pakoras live here, and I have no qualms about plucking them from their adorable serving tray and eating their faces off
Really buttery naan, so if you like butter as much as I do, you will be adequately sated
Croissants are yummy and my daughter loved the cookies after the meal
The Wor Won Ton soup was fair
The wontons had almost no meat in them, such little meat that I thought there was nothing there until I took a closer look
The egg rolls were overcooked and the filling was not tasty
The fried wontons, like the soup, had almost no filling
The shrimp with lobster sauce was fair, though too salty for my tastes
The Sweet and Sour pork - again, overcooked, burned breading on the outside
The House Special Chicken was just OK - the sauce was thin, runny, and also overly salty
All of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty
Every dish (including the house special chicken over which everyone was raving) was heavily salted and just plain bland tasting
The banana/honey wontons are amazing
Love the Mongolian Beef and the Wor Won Ton soup
The House Special Chicken was different than any I'd tasted before, but probably not my favorite version of the dish
Start off with egg drop soup and crunchy noodles
The fried rice was only so-so
Do try the Sizzling Rice Shrimp
I really liked the crab puffs
The chicken chow mein tasted a lot like Panda Express, but wasn't nearly as greasy
The Won Ton soup had excellent flavor and lots of Shrimp
My son ordered the Mongolian beef - another perfectly prepared dish
Dave got the House Special Chicken -great flavor - crispy and juicy
I also love Fried Rice - again, great flavor, huge portion
I think the environemnt is perfect and I love the Veggie Salad
I also love the cilantro hummus
So, I had "Hummus with Grilled Chicken"  To be honest this is the only thing I have been a fan of
Normally the Hummus with Grilled Chicken is better this time it was just ok the Chicken didn't taste great and the Hummus was not as flavorful, But not gonna hold that against them
I like Pita jungle a lot, the pizza I had there was amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty cool
When I don't feel like cooking I come here and taste a real homemade Mediterranean dish
It was a nicely cooked, large piece of mahi-mahi with the requisite burger veggies (Tomatoes, lettuce, onions), with aioli
The sandwich was pretty good, and was a large portion for lunch
The potatoes were really tasty, but be sure to either chew a lot of gum, eat a lot of mints, or brush your teeth afterwards because that garlic packs a punch on your breath
The pitas are HORRIBLE
There hummus is to die for
I don't need to say anything other than Grilled Veggie Lavosh Wrap
They had me by the first sentence but I also absolutely love their falafel platter, thousand bean pita- (DE-Lisious open faced pita), and of course the hummus
Their italian bread served with breakfast is pretty delicious too
I had the meat lasagna and it was excellent
I already knew what I was having, the baked Penne, always great and lots of cheese
Right after my dad's first bite he proclaimed that his Marsala was one of the best he has ever had
I freakin loved my 2 sausages
best sausage i've had in a while
I had the bruschetta with fresh tomato and basil, although i wanted the portobello and roasted peppers, unfortunately, they  sold out
The food runner brought us the amazing garlic knots and yummy marinara dipping sauce, and our server took our order and we enjoyed some nice conversation
Our food arrived and I was salivating by this time, even after we destroyed two plates of the garlic knots
I ordered Chicken Piccata, which was pretty solid, but not the best I've had
My lady had the baked penne and she said it was very delicious as always, and her dad had the chicken Marsala
The reason my review isn't 5 stars is the slight lack of service, and my piccata just being pretty good and not "as good as it gets" like 5 stars says
Bread: Square, buttery and garlicky
Dip it in their red sauce for some super flavor
Thankfully, the salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly
"House Specialty" Meat Lasagna: Hefty Portion, submerged in red sauce and I had the server sprinkle a generous amount of parmesan over it
Texture of the pasta was right, meat was good and portioned correctly, the cheese and sauce was very good
Only negative was the lack of red sauce ratio with the large slab of lasagna
Spaghetti Classic with Maria's Meatballs: Nice amount of pasta (angel hair like) cooked perfectly aldente *snap*
A pair of decent sized meatballs that were meaty and flavorful
I'd come back here for their lasagna
The bread that each table automatically gets was delicious
And while basic, the spaghetti with meat sauce had a good flavor
And just wanted to suggest the pizza for tasty takeout-- far better than one of the pizza chains
I recommend Spaghetti with the Meatball
My experience has been the noodles are always perfectly prepared al-dente, the sauce is flavorful, and the meatball generous
Coupled with a house side salad, and the garlic squares with sexy sauce that is the Brigitte Bardot of sauces
The house side salad is a glorious, hearty offering with garbanzo beans, radicchio, and other delicious vegetables dressed with an alluring Italian vinaigrette
Meat cooked so perfectly it just melt in your mouth - So full  of flavor as the fat was marbled proportional into the meat evenly
We started with a few appetizers, the crab cake is big enough to share for two and had more crab than fillers =)
The rock shrimp with the lemon aioli was quite good
The calamari just seemed pretty average, not too spectacular
while the steak was flavorful since I ordered the dry aged bone in rib eye cajun style
the meat just wasn't tender like a nice marbled rib eye should be
The side dishes really didn't impress me as well, the lobster mac and cheese was a little lack luster with small little bits of lobster noted
The grilled veggies were typical fare and you can probably get this at Red Robin's
The highlight of the sides were the button mushrooms and the creamed corn
the best steak house in vegas and dougnuts for desert rock and this is coming from guy who lived in nyc its whole life
And if youre looking for a good steak, N9NE does not disappoint
The meat is flavorful and they seem to have cooks that actually know what they are doing - which in some places is rare (pardon the pun)
We had the 40oz Rib Eye for two which they nailed
I thought I would never rave over salad and soup but I swear on my life, the best I've ever had
Next I had the halibut which was succulent and fresh
Expect to throw down lots of  money, but these steaks are worth it
Quality steaks and great sides, good cocktails and beer selection
Don't forget to order the campfire smores for desert
The chicken wing was tiny but flavorful
Risotto was amazing, very rich and savory
Crabcake was good but I was expecting the best I ever had, which it was a distant second
Steaks were cooked to perfection, the entire table savored every bite
Creamed spinach was probably the least favorite thing on the table, and the lobster mashed potatoes were just ok at best
Potato and celery soup - Small cup came out and wasn't as heavy as I expect most potato soups to be
French onion soup and garbage salad (a salad with a bit of everything) - LOVVEE both of these in concept and N9NE did them well
Bits of bleu cheese, olives, salami, tomato and others all over salad is always a good time
The soup was on point
I could have the crispy duck (yum) but minus the pancakes as they use the mixed wheat/rice flour one's, rather than just rice paper rolls
The chicken and sweetcorn soup was delicious as was my chicken and cashew nuts (with boiled rice)
Pizza's are greasy, tough and a bit flavourless, and the other offers on the menu arent that great either - in fact, all of the food is, while still worthy of eating, not the tastierst or most satisfying food I have ever had
I had a pepperoni pizza which tasted like the topping had been made with pepperamis and cheese-strings
The pizza I had there was quite good, but I'd say this place is best saved for the end of a night out, when the smell of grease and the idea if Italian food will satisfy anyone
I tried their famous Atomic Burger, and it was freaking AMAZING!
