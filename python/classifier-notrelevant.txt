Pretty good dinner with a nice selection of food
Open 24 hours and provide nice service
I usually go here after a night of partying
Good truck stop dining at the right price
We love coming here on the weekends when we don't feel like cooking
If you like lot lizards, you'll love the Pine Cone
Enjoyable experience for the whole family
The wait staff was courteous and friendly
the food was reasonably priced and a good value
the deserters are great but huge
Plan to bring some home
One of my favorite truck stop diners with solid food and friendly, quick service
My god, those desserts are huge
Would definitely be back if I was in the area
My only problem with it at the time was that they allowed smoking, so I left smelling like a cigarette
With the change in law, I'm sure the atmosphere has improved
Great truck stop restaurant
I've had breakfast and dinner here and it has always been good
Huge portions and reasonable prices
The bakery I guess is legendary
Eclairs the size of your arm and Cream Puffs that are about 10" high
On our most recent trip in the area, stopped at the gas station attached to the restaurant fo some quick snacks and of course BAKERY
If you are driving by and see the sign for The Pine Cone Restaurant - Take the next off ramp and stop it
Yeah, thats right a five freakin star rating
Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest
Be prepared to eat
I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts
Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one
I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery
I knew I was home
I can't say enough about dinner
Everything is homemade
They don't add alot of salt, if any
You can tell its fresh
Its plentiful
Its cheap
You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing
You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home
In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours
The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone
Friendly,quick service, normal prices
00)
Do stop by this place
The atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable
The waitress asked if I wanted it warmed with some butter
I thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that
She nodded agreement
Odd but also kind of humorous
The service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51
Be sure to go here instead
Their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s
take a table
start a conversations with the truck driver to your left
Must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street
That place now sits empty
Why is this area depressed
Don't ask me, I don't know
Do I look like I have all the answers
The food here is good and the prices are cheap
Go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery
Or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods
Well worth the stop
i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it's pretty perfect
prices are right on, baked goods are pretty great
service is fast and friendly - really fast
i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal
i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by
it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is
sure it's a "greasy spoon" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread
can't recommend this place enough for great breakfasts
With a recent addition of a truck driver for a BF I have found myself frequenting truck stops to dine
This little place is quite a pleasant surprise
Everything is homemade and quite good
The baked goods in the front counter were amazing
This is one of the best breakfasts I have had
Is the decor dated
Absolutely but it just adds to the nostalgic charm
The place just reeks of beef cooking
Ahhh delicious
Check out the pastry cases
OMG, is all I have to say
hands down one of the best breakfasts my wife and i have had
stopped in here based on the positive reviews from fellow yelpers and was sure glad i did
this is a good sized diner at a truck stop
tip - be sure to save space for at least one
people behind us had links on their plate and they didnt look too appetzing
overall, great experience and we were in and out in 35 mins so we could continue out journey
looking forward to stopping here again sometime soon
This is definitely not your usual truck stop
We had a young waitress who I think was new
We found her to be sweet, polite and trying very hard
The lady managing the restaurant was really rude to her
We could all hear it
A delicious breakfast
HOWEVER, the parkinglot/gas station area is filthy
Strewn with debris, dead cars, broken glass
If you judge a book by this cover you would NEVER venture inside
I hope the Mgr
sees this and cleans up
Don't be fooled because it's in a truck stop, truckers know where there are good places to eat
grin
Don't miss this place
Continuing on my Saturday morning hangover theme: there's just something about a plateful of greasy food when you're slightly hung over that makes it all better
The Pine Cone has down-home, rib-sticking, greasy food in spades
I could'nt finish mine
BUT--I didn't come here in search of health food, and it was just what the doctor ordered
I'll work out later
Some times Jane and Michael Stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food
I would definitely return to the Pine Cone
It's a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the Wisconsin highway
I live in Chicago and work in a famous Mexican restaurant and I get up to Wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible: it gives me the energy to do my job
This little truck stop gives me the big energy to get even deeper into steak and butter territory
I like this location better than the one near Johnson's creek
It is a bit tight when you walk in, but the charm soon takes over
I was not really impressed by the food
Try it all
Delicious, perfection
The service is a little slow but once again, it is a small restaurant with lots of charm
You get what you get and I love it
It is near a Christmas tree farm so it is the perfect place to stop and get some cocoa on your way
Prarie Cafe & Bakery exists in one of those cafe/restaurant purgatories in which nothing is offensive and nothing is remarkable
The food is good but there are better brunch places in Madison
It has a cozy feel but I can't tell if they want to be a cafe/coffee shop or a restaurant
Cash Only
I'm not running back but will probably return at some point
I must say I rather like this place, even though I wish they took credit cards
Great pastries and tea, as well as good veggie breakfast options
Not the fastest service but worth the wait
I'm soo confused
Am I in a post office, sit down restaurant, or casual coffee shop
If you were going for the blend of all three, then heck, I guess you nailed it
Seriously
There are postal boxes in this joint
The best things I can say about this was that the coffee was hot
Nothing great, nothing terrible
It was warm but took fooooooooorrrr-eeeeeeev-errrrrrrrrrr
It was just okay
They don't accept plastic
I can understand your local dive bar or small coffee shop not wanting to accept plastic, but for what (I think) they are trying to do here, I would expect them to accept cards
But they don't
If you think about it, it almost seems like they are going back to the good ol' days of the general store
Middleton's one-stop shop
You can check your postal box, get your coffee, get your paper, and buy random goods
Besides a hitching post for your horse, what more could you need
Take it
Leave it
Whatever
From scratch pastries, breads, breakfast, lunch, dinner options
Cozy coffee shop atmosphere, fireplace, plenty of tables
Cash only
Pay at front and they will bring the food out to you
Free refills on coffee
Never dissapointed
I've been here at least 8 or 9 times since the August 2010 review
time for an update
small space
We were there today as part of a team outing, and several folks commented about the pancakes - they are truly great, with a good sear, excellent flavor, and perfect texture
I ate here twice this week
The first time with 5 others for a lunch meeting
the second time with my wife & daughter for a light brunch
Both days were warm and muggy so I started with an iced coffee
It was huge, like an omelette on the same toasted bread as my BLT a few days before
The power was out while we were there today, but the staff worked hard to serve everything on the menu
